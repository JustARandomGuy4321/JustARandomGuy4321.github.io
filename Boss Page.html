<h1>Bosses</h1>
<h1><p>There are many bosses in Mega Boss Survival. They have difficulties, which are <br>Easy, Medium, Hard, Very Hard, Impossible, Beyond Inmaginable, Godly, Mythic, <br>Omega, and Infinity. <br>
    If you want to survive the bosses, you will need to use strategies. For bosses <br>ranging from Easy to Godly, a strategy could be to find shelter, or go on a ceiling <br>of a structure. For bosses ranging from Mythic to Infinity, your best strategy is <br>to just run. For example, the Witherstorm has an aura that removes your health, <br>and floats around. Run. Just Run. <br>
    
    There is only one Infinity boss, and it is the God Kraken. It is almost impossible <br>to survive on land, because its 300 tentacles grab you and fling you away, <br>making you take terrifying damage. Your best strategy is to hitchhike a UFO or <br>a spaceship, making you go in the air, where the God Kraken cannot get you.</p></h1>
