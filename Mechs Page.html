<h1>Mechs</h1>
<h1><p>There are things you can drive, and there are currently 3 types. Mechs, Jaegars, <br>and Dragons. There are many mechs, and all of them have a sword. Some <br>obtainable mechs are the angel mech, which you obtain by climbing the Stairs of Heaven. <br>Obtain the stone mech by finding it in the treasure island. It is the <br>same case with the grass mech, water mech and sand mech. <br>
    Jaegars are basically huge mechs, and there are currently four Jaegars in the <br>game. They are the Gipsy Danger, Obsidian Fury, Walking House, and Purple <br>Walking House. <br>
    Dragons are extremely rare, and they fly. There are also four dragons in the <br>game. The Default Dragon, the Ice Dragon, The Black Dragon, and The <br>Radioactive Dragon. <br>
    There is also the UFO, and the Spaceships, which you can buy for 9 million points. <br>The Mothership is the rarest mode of transportation. Only 23 people <br>have it, and that number is very likely to stay that way for a long time.</p></h1>
