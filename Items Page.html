 <h1>Items</h1>
 <h1><p>You need your gear to survive bosses. There are weapons, and springs that <br>boost your speed, jump power, and hp recovery. Weapons start with the sword, <br>and up tho the most powerful weapons, The Gaster Blaster which deals 50000 <br>damage per hit, and the Rainbow Sword, whic summons a gigantic sword and <br>shoots a beam of light, instantly vaporizing any boss that is unlucky enough to <br>be in its way. 

    Gears, on the other hand, donâ€™t deal any damage, and boost your abilities. The <br>speed and mega speed coils boost your speed. The gravity and mega gravity <br>coils boost your jump strength, while the mega regen coil (there is no regen coil)<br> instantly recovers all your health. </p></h1>
